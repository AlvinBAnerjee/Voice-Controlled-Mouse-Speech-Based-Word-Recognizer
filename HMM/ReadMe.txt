HMM.cpp file has to be run. 
Everything is menu  driven so only running the program in Visual Studio will Do.
I have pre recorded my recordings and have built a codebook using those recordings after generating the Ceptral Coefficients
The whole procedure of building the codebook will take a max of 20 sec depending on the computational power of your 
PC in my case (8 sec) and (19 sec in a very old laptop)
In the offline testing using 100 training samples for all the digits, I am getting an accuracy of 94
Also I have added the feature of live testing which will keep checking your vocal inputs until you
give it the command to stop. Like everything its menu driven and the terminal will display the message

Thank You
